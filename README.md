# angular1x
This is one of the test project of mine. I was trying to develop conditional logic between ng-repeater Angular JS and want to show a loop within a loop when a particular condition is matched. 
In simple words I need to show thumbnails row wise and column wise form json data. 
Thus, these files shows;
1) use of ng-repeater within ng-repeater
2) creating gallery thumbnail view using UIKit and Angular JS 
3) Fetching Server data using Angular JS
